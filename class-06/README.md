# Class 6

This repository plots all of the earthquakes in the past day from the USGS Earthquake API by magnitude and depth into a scatterplot to easily visualize any correlations between the two data values. From this scatterplot it appears that the majority of earthquakes occur between a depth between 0-20km and up to a magnitude of 2.5.

Additionally, the scatterplot is interactive. You can hover over any of the points to view the exact data values for the depth and magnitude of the specific earthquake.
