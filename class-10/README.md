# Why The Geysers

The Geysers, located in Northern California, produces some of the most earthquakes in a small area within the U.S. on a weekly occurrence. The cause for these earthquakes are not entirely a natural occurrence, but the result of past drilling activities for the withdrawal of steam to produce electric power (https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9827/3374). Due to the seismicity at The Geysers, I believe this webmap would be a valuable tool to keep track of the magnitudes and depths of all of the earthquakes in case a large earthquake were to occur. This webmap provides a legend, abilities to zoom and drag, as well as hover-over tooltips providing exact information for each earthquake.
