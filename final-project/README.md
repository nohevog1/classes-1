# Mars Landing Sites

This project presents an interactive globe of Mars as well as the location of landing sites of Mars landers and additional information about those sites using two different JavaScript libraries: D3.js and Three.js.

## Documentation

1. The overall goal of my final project was to create an interactive globe of Mars that presented the location of previous landers on the surface in D3.js. This application would allow users to rotate, zoom, and hover over points for more information about a specific landing site location. This was all acheived using D3.js, but at the cost of zoom issues as well as performance and optimization (which you can see in the D3.js project site). Therefore, I was urged by my professor to recreate this project using a combination of Three.js and D3.js, which proved to be very successful with some minor cosmetic enhancements (as seen above in the Three.js project site).
